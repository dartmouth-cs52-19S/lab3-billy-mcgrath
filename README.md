In this lab, I built a notes app using React and Firebase. I started by just configuring the creation of the notes in a similar way to what we did in the video short assignment and then built off of that. The React event handlers make it really easy to update the notes and perform certain actions based on changes. Firebase was helpful for storing data, and I preferred using that database to Immutable.js.

What worked:
- I think I got basically all of the minimum specs working. It took some time and some help, but I got there
- It took me a little bit to understand the Firebase docs, but once I did it all went rather smoothly compared to Immutable.
- That's about it. I've been super sick and didn't have the energy to try any extra credit.

What didn't work:
- My immune system while trying to complete this lab.
- There is still an issue where if you pull the note too fast to start, sometimes it will look like just the text is being pulled. However, this gets fixed once you stop dragging the note
- I still do not have a firm grasp of props and states. I got help on two methods from Avery Vanacore (which I cited), which then helped me understand how to use props and states in other areas of the assignment, but did not bring me to a full understanding.
